## Graph Theory SketchPad
My attempt at a Graph Theory SketchPad for CptS 453.
Written in Python using the pygame library.

## Build status
Work in progress.

## How to use?
- Run sketchPad.py
- Click an empty space to create a Vertex
- New Vertex will be selected, indicated by red outline
- Click empty space to clear selection
- Create another Vertex
- While a Vertex is selected, click another Vertex to create an Edge between them
- Click and drag a Vertex to move it
- When a Vertex or an Edge is selected, press Delete to remove it
- When a Vertex is selected, press Enter to update the Reachable list (All Vertices that can be reached from the selection)
- When a Vertex is selected, press the Left or Right Arrow Keys to change its color
